# Email CDR
 ![CDR][images/EmailCDR.png]
 
 As an experienced software developer, I specialize in creating robust, reliable, and user-friendly applications that prioritize security. One of my standout projects is an email application that utilizes a machine learning-based content detection and removal (CDR) system as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering. This CDR system enhances email security by detecting and eliminating potentially hazardous content, such as malicious macros, untrusted links, and embedded code.

For example, the CDR system can detect and remove embedded code that may be used to execute a malicious script or exploit a vulnerability in the recipient's system. It can also identify and eliminate untrusted links that may lead to phishing websites or other malicious pages. Additionally, the system is able to detect and remove malicious macros that may be embedded in an email, potentially allowing an attacker to gain access to the recipient's system or data.

In addition to providing a secure email platform, this application also has the potential to be used as an attack vector by adversaries. That is why I have leveraged my expertise in implementing CDR machine learning models to design and develop a system that can effectively detect and neutralize any such threats. The relevant documentation of the application showcases my skills and knowledge in this area.


Overall, my extensive experience in creating secure applications has equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to deliver top-quality software solutions that meet the needs of my clients and users.
